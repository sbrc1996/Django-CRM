# Django-CRM
Basic Django Project to demonstrate a CRM

Here we have designed a basic CRM using Python3 and Django. We have generated static web pages using HTML and in those static pages
generated dynamic content using Django templates. 

Django templates is very much similar to the Spring Boot Thymleaf. 

It is a very basic project but very helpful in learning the barebones of Django.
